During the last decades, the total number of
vehicles around the world growing enormously.
Especially in India traffic is growing four times faster
than the population. Road safety has become a main
issue for governments and car manufacturers in the
last twenty years.
The development of new vehicular technologies
has shifted companies, researchers and institutions to
focus their efforts on improving road safety. The
evolution in wireless technologies has allowed
researchers to design communication systems where
vehicles directly take part in the network. Thus
networks such as VANETs are created to facilitate
communication between vehicles themselves and
between vehicles and road side unit. Vehicular ad hoc
network (VANET) is a technology which uses
moving cars as nodes in a network to create a mobile
network [2]. New concepts like smart cities and
living labs has emerged in the last years where
vehicular networks play an important role.
VANETs are getting attention due to the various
important applications related to traffic controlling
and road safety. Smart cities full of traffic would like
to minimize their transportation problems due to the
increasing population that results in congested roads.
VANET helps to solve this issue by improving
vehicles¡¯ mobility and also helps at having more safe
and sophisticated cities. At the beginning of the
development of vehicular technologies, the more
focus was on building efficient and more safe roads.
But nowadays huge development of wireless
technologies and their application in vehicles, it
becomes possible to use Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) that will change our way to drive and
help emergency critical services. VANETs provide
easier communication facility among vehicles and
also with fixed infrastructure. This will not only
improve the road safety, but also gives benefits
commercially.
Pollution and congestion reduction, accidents
prevention, safer roads are some of the benefits of
VANETs. The development of an efficient system in
VANETs has many important benefits, to the traffic
police as well as to the drivers. Proper traffic alerts
and updated information about traffic incidents will
make safe driving, increase road safety and reduce
the traffic jams in the city. It also helps to indentify
where the traffic rules violations takes place.
Furthermore, it also helps in economic ways; realtime
traffic alerting will reduce trip time and fuel
consumption and therefore decrease pollution as well
[3]. So it is definitely beneficial in many ways.
Remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
In section II, we briefly describe the related work.
Various Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is
discussed in this section. System overview is
described in Section III. Further our proposed scheme
and various routing protocols are compared with
respect to our proposed scheme in this Section and at
last paper is concluded in Section IV.
In the last decades, Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) have emerged as an efficient way to
improve the performance of the flow of vehicles on
the roads. The goal of ITS is to provide comfortable
driving, road safety and distribution of updated
information about the roads. Various research work
related to ITS have been presented in recent years.
Some work about ITS in smart cities is presented in
this section.
Inter-vehicular communication is presented based
on an adaptive traffic signal control system [4]. This
system reduces the waiting time of the vehicles at the
square also results in reduction in waiting time at the
signal. To realize this system, the concept of
clustering is used to collect the data of the vehicles
coming towards the intersection. Clustering algorithm
is used to compute density of vehicles within the
cluster and sent to the traffic signal controls to set the
timing cycle. It uses Direction based clustering
algorithm. This algorithm is a combination of
opportunistic dissemination technique and cluster and
it is used to gather the required traffic information.
The clusters are created using the direction of the
vehicles in a given predefined geographic region
approaching the intersection. By employing GPS and
digital maps the direction parameter is computed
within the vehicles.
System that takes the control decisions based on
the information coming from the vehicles is very well
described by the authors [5]. Every vehicle is
equipped with a short range communication device
and controller nodes are placed in the intersection
with traffic lights. This controller node at intersection
acts as adaptive control signal system.
In [4] and [5] two adaptive traffic light systems
based on wireless communication between vehicles
and fixed controller nodes deployed at squares are
designed. Both systems improve traffic fluency,
reduce the waiting time of vehicles at squares and
help to avoid collisions.
The work in [6] is a survey about multifunctional
data driven intelligent transportation system, which
collects a large amount of data from various
resources: Vision-Driven ITS (input data collected
from video sensors and used recognition including
vehicle and pedestrian detection); Multisource-Driven
ITS (e.g. inductive-loop detectors, laser radar and
GPS); Learning-Driven ITS (effective prediction of
the occurrence of accidents to enhance the safety of
pedestrians by reducing the impact of vehicle
collision);and Visualization-Driven ITS (to help
decision makers quickly identify abnormal traffic
patterns and accordingly take necessary measures).
But, it requires large amount of memory to stores the
videos. Also in some complex situations as shown in
figure 1, there are some problems regarding object
reorganization.
In such a situation it becomes difficult to identify
each vehicle and perhaps to find out the centroid of
every vehicle. Hence it creates problems in traffic
density calculation. Another problem is while doing
object extraction, if the color of vehicle and the color
of background become same then it becomes difficult
to uniquely identify the object. Again we have to
keep video data which is very large in size.
The e-NOTIFY [7] system was designed for
automatic accident detection, which sends the
message to the Emergencies Center and assistance of
road accidents using the capabilities offered by
vehicular communication technologies. e-NOTIFY
focuses on improving post collision care with the fast
and efficient management of the available emergency
resources, which increases the chances of recovery
and survival for those injured in traffic accidents. The
e-NOTIFY system combines both V2V and V2I
communications to efficiently notify an accident
situation to the Control Center. Different vehicles
should incorporate an On- Board unit (OBU)
responsible for (i) detecting when there has been a
potentially dangerous impact for the occupants, (ii)
collecting available information from sensors in the
car, and (iii) communicating the situation to a Control
Unit (CU) that will address the treatment of the
warning notification and its subsequent sending.
